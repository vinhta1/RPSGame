Big thanks to [Looking-Glass, wormyrocks, jethac, playfulbacon](https://github.com/Looking-Glass/JoyconLib) and [vksokolov](https://github.com/vksokolov/JoyConUnity) for creating the libraries that our code developed upon.
Most of their code exists here updated, changed, and merged to fuction within our game. I don't understand most of the code, but it works well enough!
